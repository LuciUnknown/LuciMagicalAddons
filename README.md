# LuciMagicalAddon
This mod is custom made for Piekamopaka, the greatest modpack on the platform.

I advise installing it from thunderstore or R2ModMan for your own safety. I don't know what happens if you don't. (But if you do please contact me what happens, 3 people triend and none of them answered in weeks)

!!! remember the mod won't work without tips and posters folders
